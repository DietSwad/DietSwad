## 13. Do Not Track (DNT) Signals and Browser Privacy Settings

### 13.1 Current DNT Support

Our website does **not currently respond to Do Not Track (DNT)** browser signals.

**Reason:** There is no universal industry standard for how websites should interpret and respond to DNT signals. Different browsers implement DNT differently, and advertising platforms (Meta, Google) don't honor DNT for their tracking pixels.

### 13.2 Alternative Privacy Controls Available to You

**Browser-Level Controls:**

**Cookie Settings:**
- Block third-party cookies: Prevents cross-site tracking
- Block all cookies: Maximum privacy but breaks site functionality
- Delete cookies regularly: Clears tracking history

**Private/Incognito Browsing:**
- Doesn't save browsing history or cookies
- Limits tracking across sessions
- **Note:** Websites can still track you within a single private browsing session

**Tracking Prevention Features:**
- **Safari:** Intelligent Tracking Prevention (ITP)
- **Firefox:** Enhanced Tracking Protection
- **Brave Browser:** Built-in ad and tracker blocking
- **Edge:** Tracking prevention (Balanced or Strict mode)

**Privacy-Focused Browsers:**
- Brave: Blocks ads and trackers by default
- Firefox Focus: Mobile browser designed for privacy
- DuckDuckGo Browser: Blocks hidden trackers

### 13.3 Browser Extensions for Enhanced Privacy

**Tracker Blockers:**
- **Privacy Badger** (EFF): Learns and blocks invisible trackers
- **uBlock Origin:** Blocks ads and trackers
- **Ghostery:** Shows and blocks trackers on each page

**Ad Blockers:**
- **AdBlock Plus**
- **AdGuard**

**Cookie Management:**
- **Cookie AutoDelete:** Automatically deletes cookies when tabs close
- **EditThisCookie:** View and manage cookies easily

**Facebook-Specific:**
- **Facebook Container (Firefox):** Isolates Facebook tracking from rest of browsing

### 13.4 Platform-Level Opt-Outs

**Meta (Facebook/Instagram):**
- [Facebook Ad Preferences](https://www.facebook.com/adpreferences)
- Turn off "Ads based on data from partners"
- Turn off "Ads based on your activity on Facebook"

**Google:**
- [Google Ad Settings](https://adssettings.google.com)

**Industry-Wide Opt-Outs:**
- [Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA)](https://optout.aboutads.info/)
- [Network Advertising Initiative (NAI)](https://optout.networkadvertising.org/)

### 13.5 Impact of Using Privacy Controls

**Maximum Privacy Settings:**
- ✅ Minimal tracking of your browsing
- ✅ Fewer personalized ads
- ❌ May break website functionality (forms, checkout)
- ❌ Ads become less relevant (generic ads still shown)
- ❌ May need to re-enter information frequently

**Balanced Privacy Settings:**
- ✅ Blocks most invasive tracking
- ✅ Website functions normally
- ⚠️ Some tracking still occurs for essential functions
- ⚠️ Still see personalized ads from platforms you use

**We Respect Your Choices:** Whatever privacy settings you choose, we'll work within those constraints to provide the best possible service.
